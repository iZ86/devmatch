                    A standard hotel room is typically a cozy and well-appointed space 
                    designed for comfort and convenience. It generally includes a 
                    comfortable queen or king-size bed with fresh linens and plush 
                    pillows. The room features a work desk with a chair, a flat-screen 
                    television, a mini-fridge, and a coffee/tea maker. Thereâ€™s often a 
                    wardrobe or closet for clothing storage and a small seating area 
                    with an armchair or two. The decor is usually simple yet elegant, 
                    with neutral tones and modern furnishings. The en-suite bathroom is 
                    equipped with a shower or bathtub, a vanity with a mirror, 
                    toiletries, and fresh towels. Basic amenities like free Wi-Fi, 
                    air conditioning, and a safe are also provided. Large windows often 
                    let in natural light, and some rooms may offer views of the city or 
                    the surrounding landscape.
